### Next Steps

TODO

Make a function in server.js that does the following:
Make api call to /all to get an updated list of burgers
Empty out the two columns that have burgers
Populate those two columns with the updated list and devoured burgers

Mps over all the burgers, if devoured write here else there
Function that can take a single burger object and output some html that displays it in a panel or card or <li>
Also need to make a button on the undevoured column that lets you devour it
That button needs to be able to track in the id of the burger
The id will let you make an api request to that burger's id, and devour it

Once you've devoured OR created a new burger, just call this populate function to refresh you page content

TODO Updated
Add a selector for Add-a-burger
